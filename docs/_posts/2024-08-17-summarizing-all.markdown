excerpt: "The `first` and the `second` deliverables are imagined."
---

`Anominous` and I have agreed on what the first runway should look like.
And, from that we can see our first two deliverables:

* A baseline library and manages attributes for player characters, like `special` of F04. 
* An injection point for the ML service, like a pure function, that responds with particular behavior to game scenarios.

This will also give us opportunities to refresh our ML skills in addition to our coding skills.
