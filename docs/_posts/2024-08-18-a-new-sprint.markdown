Munchkins are full of ideas and eager to eat their LOLs.
As expected, of course.
However, the organization skills are on par with other 14-year-olds.

What falls on 'Dada' are less exciting tasks, such as capturing the docs and setting up CI/CD
exactly the way the Munchkins have envisioned and prototyped.

No surprised here, daddy is always the "finisher."
Nevertheless, the new sprint will be a lot of fun.
And, I hope, self-organized better by our Munchkins.

Today Lugaru and I will release the baseline to start the sprint.

One other important deliverable for today is the started sprint objective,
which we will capture in a separate post.
