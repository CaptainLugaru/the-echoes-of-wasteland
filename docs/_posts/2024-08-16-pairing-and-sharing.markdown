Hello everyone! 
Today was our first fun pairing session.

We did have to wait a little bit for `rdd13r` 
to configure the necessary users on some Mac boxes 
we had used for this activity.
But outside of that, it was a fun creative time.

`rdd13r` continues to work on setting up our community site.
Most probably `lugaru` will complete this over the weekend with him.
