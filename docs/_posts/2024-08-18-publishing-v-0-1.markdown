Got R!dd13r to publish all our staging workups and fix any Jekyll configuration issues.
Then, Anominous and I have decided to publish v.0.1.
We have also decided on the initial roadmap and what the tentative final goal should be.

In This sprint, we organize ourselves around concrete deliverables.
We also set up our resources such as scrum board and discussion board.
And we get R!dd13r to help us with the unit testing, and then publishing the artifact.
We have not decided on pull requests yet.
And we have not decided who pushed what when we pair and swarm, but that may not matter now.

Also, R!dd13r commited to document the rest of the box setup we've done with Anominous.

So, we start daily planning tomorrow.
